## Drake Maye Deep Dive

### The NFL's Most Efficient Quarterback

Drake Maye's 2025 season represents one of the most impressive quarterback performances in recent history, especially for a young player. He leads the NFL in every major efficiency metric while maintaining elite aggression downfield.

### Rankings Among 46 QBs

| Category | Rank | Value | Percentile |
|----------|------|-------|------------|
| **EPA per Play** | #1 | 0.298 | Top 2% |
| **Success Rate** | #1 | 54.4% | Top 2% |
| **CPOE** | #1 | 10.78 | Top 2% |
| **Yards per Attempt** | #1 | 7.38 | Top 2% |
| **Explosive Play Rate** | #1 | 12.4% | Top 2% |
| **Completion %** | #2 | 65.6% | Top 4% |
| **Deep Ball Yards** | #2 | 1,093 | Top 4% |
| **Air Yards/Attempt** | #2 | 9.13 | Top 4% |

### Historic Efficiency Performance

**EPA Leadership**: Maye's 0.298 EPA per play isn't just #1 - it's 25% better than #2 Jordan Love (0.239). This margin of dominance is rare.

**Success Rate Dominance**: 54.4% success rate is 10.3 percentage points above league average (44.1%). This represents exceptional play-to-play execution.

**Accuracy Excellence**: CPOE of 10.78 means Maye completes passes at a rate significantly above what would be expected given the difficulty of his throws.

### Deep Ball Mastery (20+ Air Yards)

- **70 deep attempts** - Top 5 in volume
- **35 completions** - Exceptional conversion
- **50.0% deep completion rate** - 15 percentage points above league average (35.0%)
- **1,093 deep yards** - #2 in NFL, only 164 yards behind Stafford despite 20 fewer attempts
- **7 deep TDs**

**Key Insight**: A 50% completion rate on deep balls with 70 attempts is historically elite. Most QBs either:
- Throw deep rarely and maintain accuracy
- Throw deep frequently but struggle with completion rate

Maye does both - high volume AND historic accuracy.

### The Complete Quarterback Package

**Efficiency**: #1 in EPA, Success Rate, CPOE, YPA
**Aggression**: #2 in air yards per attempt (9.13)
**Accuracy**: #2 in completion percentage (65.6%)
**Big Plays**: #1 in explosive pass rate (12.4%)

### Young QB Comparison (2023-2024 Draft Classes)

| Rank | QB | Team | EPA/Play | Success Rate | Deep Attempts |
|------|-----|------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | **D. Maye** | **NE** | **0.298** | **54.4%** | **70** |
| 2 | B. Nix | DEN | 0.092 | 44.3% | 72 |
| 3 | C. Williams | CHI | 0.071 | 43.1% | 82 |
| 4 | M. Penix | ATL | -0.004 | 45.2% | 35 |
| 5 | J. Daniels | WAS | -0.023 | 44.4% | 18 |
| 6 | J. McCarthy | MIN | -0.198 | 40.3% | 35 |

Maye's EPA is **3.3x better** than the second-best young QB. This is a generational gap.

### What Makes Maye Special

**1. Elite Efficiency AND Aggression**
Most QBs sacrifice one for the other. Maye excels at both simultaneously.

**2. Learning Curve Defied**
Young QBs typically struggle with consistency and decision-making. Maye plays like a 10-year veteran.

**3. Complete Skill Set**
- Deep ball accuracy (50% on 20+ yards)
- Short/intermediate precision (65.6% overall)
- Situational excellence (46.4% on third down)
- Big play creation (#1 in explosive passes)

### The Drake Maye Formula

```
Historic Efficiency + Aggressive Downfield Passing + Elite Accuracy = Best QB in NFL
```

Unlike most QBs who excel in one or two areas, Maye dominates across all metrics. This is what separates good QBs from franchise cornerstones.

## Matt Stafford Deep Dive

### Why Stafford Stands Out

Matthew Stafford represents a unique archetype: the **elite volume deep-ball passer**. While many QBs either throw deep infrequently or struggle with efficiency when they do, Stafford excels at both.

### Rankings Among 46 QBs

| Category | Rank | Value | Percentile |
|----------|------|-------|------------|
| **Total Passing Yards** | #1 | 3,877 | Top 2% |
| **Total Touchdowns** | #1 | 27 | Top 2% |
| **EPA per Play** | #3 | 0.227 | Top 7% |
| **Deep Ball Yards** | #1 | 1,257 | Top 2% |
| **Deep Ball TDs** | #2 | 10 | Top 4% |
| **Air Yards/Attempt** | #3 | 9.09 | Top 7% |
| **Yards per Attempt** | #3 | 6.25 | Top 7% |

### Deep Ball Dominance (20+ Air Yards)

- **90 deep attempts** - Most in NFL (20 more than #2)
- **39 completions** on deep balls
- **43.3% deep completion rate** - 8.3% above league average (35.0%)
- **1,257 deep yards** - #1 in NFL by 164 yards
- **10 deep TDs** - #2 in league

### Air Yards Leadership

Stafford's **9.09 air yards per attempt** ranks #3 in the NFL, behind only:
- Marcus Mariota (10.1) - but with -0.016 EPA/play
- Drake Maye (9.13) - with excellent 0.298 EPA/play

**Key Insight**: Stafford throws 1.38 yards deeper per attempt than league average while maintaining top-3 efficiency. This is the hallmark of an elite downfield passer.

### The Stafford Formula

```
High Volume + Deep Aggression + High Efficiency = Elite Production
```

Most QBs sacrifice one of these three elements:
- **Conservative QBs**: High efficiency, low air yards
- **Gunslingers**: High air yards, lower efficiency
- **Game Managers**: Lower volume, short passes

**Stafford achieves all three simultaneously**, making him uniquely valuable in 2025.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Efficiency Matters More Than Volume

Drake Maye leads the league in EPA/play despite fewer attempts (540) than many peers. Quality over quantity drives winning football.

### 2. Deep Ball Success Varies Widely

- **Elite deep passers**: Stafford (43.3%), Maye, Darnold
- **League average**: 35.0% completion on 20+ yard throws
- **Struggling**: Several QBs under 30% on deep attempts

### 3. Traditional Stats Don't Tell Full Story

Patrick Mahomes ranks #8 in EPA/play despite lower completion percentage (58.4%), demonstrating that context-aware metrics reveal true value better than raw stats.

### 4. Success Rate vs CPOE Reveals Playing Styles

QBs in the upper-right quadrant (high success rate + positive CPOE) represent the most valuable players:
- Maye, Stafford, Love all excel in both metrics
- Some QBs succeed through scheme (high success, low CPOE)
- Others through talent (high CPOE, moderate success)

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **nflreadr** R package - official NFL play-by-play data
- **Season**: 2025 regular season
- **Minimum**: 100 pass attempts (46 QBs qualified)

### Key Metrics Explained

**EPA (Expected Points Added)**
- Measures value added on each play relative to expected outcome
- Positive EPA = above average performance
- Negative EPA = below average performance

**CPOE (Completion Percentage Over Expected)**
- Accounts for difficulty of throws (distance, pressure, coverage)
- Positive CPOE = completing harder throws than expected
- Shows QB accuracy independent of scheme

**Success Rate**
- Percentage of plays that maintain or improve down-and-distance situation
- Binary measure: was the play "successful" for offense?

**Air Yards**
- Distance ball travels in air from line of scrimmage to target
- Measures downfield aggression
- Independent of yards after catch (YAC)
